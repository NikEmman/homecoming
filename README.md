## 🎮 How to Play

When the game loads, you’ll see the **title screen** and basic instructions.

### 🧠 Plan Your Moves

Use the **arrow keys** to **queue** the vacuum’s moves.
Each key press adds one step to your planned path:

- **Up** → move one tile upward
- **Down** → move one tile downward
- **Left** → move one tile left
- **Right** → move one tile right

The vacuum will **not** move yet — you're just planning.

Press **E** to **execute** your queued moves.

### ✅ Goal

To complete a level:

1. Reach **all dirty spots** on the map, and
2. Return the vacuum **home**.
