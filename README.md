# Home coming

This is a game developed with [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/)
It is a puzzle game, where the player issues commands to a robot vacuum and then watch it execute them,
in order to gather the trash in a grid-bases environment and then guide it to the home base

It's purpose is to teach children to plan out and sequence a series of moves, to achieve a goal. A sort of
intro into programming

## How to play
